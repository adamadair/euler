# euler
This project contains the code solutions I programmed for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

I only check in code that provides a correct solution for the problem, but that does not mean that I have
created the best or even good solutions.

# About the code
For most solutions I write the code in Ruby. As a secondary goal to this
exercise I am trying to improve my Ruby skills as it is not one of my primary
languages that I work with. In some cases I have developed the solution in another
language first such as C, C# or even Java.

The code I have written here is my own, but in most cases the ideas behind them are
not my own. I research the subject matter first before writing a single line of code
to create a plan. In some cases I have run across algorithms or other peoples code
solutions to similar problems and in many cases those ideas get rolled into my 
solution. I don't actively search out other code solutions on the web for these 
problems because that kind of defeats the purpose for doing these exercises. I try
to balance creating my own original solutions with having a correct and efficient
solution in the end.
