#Largest palindrome product
##Problem 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers. 

## Solution Notes
Kind of a cheat in that it converts to string for the palindrome check. This is one of Ruby's strengths.
There may actually be a mathematical solution for this, but I never even bothered to do the research. 
Moving on...
