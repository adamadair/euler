# Factorial digit sum
## Problem 20

n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

# Solution Notes
There is probably nifty mathematical way to do this, but I don't care. I just
leveraged the power of Ruby to accomplish the result than figure out the 
math.
