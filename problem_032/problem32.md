# Pandigital products
## Problem 32
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

## Solution Notes
I wrote Ruby. Lots of Ruby. This can not be the solution that they were thinking of when they came up with the problem.
On my Mac it returns the answer in about 5 seconds. I believe this can be improved, but I am not going to do it. I gave this 
a days worth of thought and this is the best I could come up with. I'm moving on.
