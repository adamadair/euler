# No Code
this one I did with a calculator. Just figure out the prime factos of all the
numbers from 1..20 and multiply them:

N = 2 * 3 * 2 * 5 * 7 * 2 * 3 * 11 * 13 * 2 * 17 * 19

I didn't figure out a good algorithm for doing this in code. I probably
won't go back and do it either. For 16 I missed a 2, so I came up short 
so I worked backward dividing by each number starting with 20. My mistake
became obvious once I got to 16.
