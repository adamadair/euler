# Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal
## Problem 45
Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle	 	Tn=n(n+1)/2	 	1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
Pentagonal	 	Pn=n(3n−1)/2	 	1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
Hexagonal	 	Hn=n(2n−1)	 	1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...
It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

# Solution Notes

1. Generate a large number of each sequence of numbers. Through trial and error I 
settled on 100000. Place each in a hash.

2. traverse the keys of the hexogonal hash, and compare with the triangle and 
pentagonal hashes. If a key is found in all three print it.
