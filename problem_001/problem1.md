# Multiples of 3 and 5
## Problem 1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# Problem Solution
My solution is problem1.rb is a simple brute force methd. The correct1.rb is by
implementation of the suggested solution. This first problem was a good indication
that in most cases the most obvious solution is rarelythe best solution and that
taking some time to think and learn about the problem befor coding would be a 
good idea.
