# Largest prime factor
## Problem 3
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

## Problem Solution
The obvious brute force method of looping through all numbers from 2 to
n and checking if the number is a divisor of n and then if it is prime
would take to long, so this is one where I started doing some research
first about prime numbers, and then I came across this [web site](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-prime-factors-of-a-given-number/)that
not only describes a pretty code algorithm for finding all the prime 
factors of a number but then provided a code solution in C. It was 
hard to ignore, so it is not a coincidence that my Ruby solution is 
very similar that one.
