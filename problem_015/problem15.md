# Lattice paths
# Problem 15

Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

# Solution Notes

I used a calculator to get the answer, since with a square grid 20x20 the number of paths are the central binomial coefficients. Its easier that way.
