# Combinatoric selections
# Problem 53
There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, 5C3 = 10.

In general,

nCr =	n!/r!(n−r)!
,where r ≤ n, n! = n×(n−1)×...×3×2×1, and 0! = 1.
It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: 23C10 = 1144066.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of  nCr, for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, are greater than one-million?

# Solution Notes
I take advantage of the large number capabilities of Ruby in my solution. The overview
from Project Euler provides some very complex mathematics that could also provide the 
soluton. I might analyze this and perhaps code it in a differenct language later.
