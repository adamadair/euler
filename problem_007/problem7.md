# 10001st prime
## Problem 7
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that 
the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?

## Solution notes
My best solutions is found in find_primes.rb which is slightly different than
the solution provided by in the problem overview. 

find2.rb is a differnt path I went down which ended up being way too slow and
it never did complete the problem. The primality test uses regular expressions
and I doubted that it would work before I even ran it, but after 30 minutes and
it was still chugging along in the 2000 range of prime numbers found and it had
slowed to a crawl, it was obvious that it wouldn't ever complete.
